1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Page was a lunatic and a fool 

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
blinded by his lust for revenge.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A blunt knife in lieu of a surgical scalpel.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He was unworthy of the task at hand

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but he served his purpose during the allotted time.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They thought me a harmless functionary

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
one of Page's numerous pawns.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
And they believe me dead.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
But it's not enough to put the king in check. 

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I gave the orders.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I deceived Phantom Unit.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I provided the false-flag intelligence

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
setting them up, forcing them to kill Page.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They performed adequately.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He drew the attention of the hegemonists

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and their focus on him kept their attention from the true threat.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The first skirmish went to the enemy

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but the war is about to begin.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And they will soon know the true meaning of terror.
