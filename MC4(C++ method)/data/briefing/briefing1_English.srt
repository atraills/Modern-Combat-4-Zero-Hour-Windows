1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When we shattered the skyline of this city...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
They called me a terrorist.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The Green Beret who betrayed his own country.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But I warned them:

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
They had no idea how far I was willing to go...

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
In order to destroy the empires of this world.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You've seen the plans.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In 47 hours, we attack Hawaii and take the President hostage.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First, we hit America's new nerve center:

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The War Crimes Investigation Division in Seattle.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We destroy the building, crippling their response time...

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we create a diversion so huge that the whole world will be focused on it.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's time to remind them how vulnerable they are.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll deploy thickened pyrophoric explosives in three locations...

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here, here and here.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The building will collapse in on itself...

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Like this impotent nation.
