1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The intel we got from Saunders indicates that Page has taken the President hostage

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and is holding him in South Africa.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Page has been using a Saunders Global Security facility

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
as a front for his Unified Citizens terrorist group.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We dug up a paper trail leading us to believe that Page has been gathering tantalum and columbite

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
two materials that can used to develop weaponry.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We don't know what Page's end game is,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but we can assume that he is preparing something big.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are deploying all our units to this location.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
These mercs are well-trained

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and the base will be strongly defended

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so expect heavy resistance.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Our troops are at a disadvantage here

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so we'll need to hit where it hurts, and fast.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This isn't a raid, it's a war.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Retrieve the President at all costs.
