1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We've confirmed that Edward Page is in Antarctica

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and we have him surrounded.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Vehicles, artillery, and infantry units are in position.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Our intel indicates that Page has developed a biochemical weapon of some kind

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
perhaps involving a genetically-modified strain of H5N1.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Anderson's experience dealing with Page during the Fallen Nation incident will prove useful on this mission.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And as a member of the AFTER team

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
he'll be able to assist when you encounter weapons of mass destruction.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is a seek-and-destroy mission.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
First priority is to locate and neutralize Page.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Whatever else happens

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we need to eliminate him.
